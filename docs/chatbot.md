# Chatbots

A chatbot is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based software that `simulates human conversation`. It analyzes the user request and outputs relevant information. Modern chatbots are called `digital assistants` and can solve many tasks. They are mainly used for customer support but can also be used for optimizing processes.

There is different types:

## Menu/button-based

This is the most basic type. It utilizes a `decision tree`  presented to a user as a `list of buttons`. Using the menu, customers can select the option they need and get the proper instructions to solve their problem or get the required information.

## Rule-based - linguistic

It uses a collection of different conditions to assess the incoming words, `detect specific word combinations` and form a response based on if/then logic. If the input matches the defined conditions, a chatbot outputs a relevant answer.

## Keyword recognition-based

It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to form answers based on the `detected keywords`. Often it is combined with the menu/button-based option to give `customers a choice` if the keyword recognition mechanism outputs poor results.

## ML-based or contextual

These chatbots utilize various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to `remember past conversations` and self-improve with time.

## Voice bots

Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant are the best examples of voice recognition-based bots. They make you feel like you are having a conversation with a human. `You don’t need to type anything` to get the required information or enable the required features. For now, these are the most complicated in implementation.
